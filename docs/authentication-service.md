## Deployment

### Docker Setup

Create a Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.17-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY go.mod ./
COPY go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

COPY . .

RUN go build -o /auth-service

EXPOSE 8081

CMD ["/auth-service"]
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

Create a Kubernetes deployment file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: auth-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: auth-service
  template:
